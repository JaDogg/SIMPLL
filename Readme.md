Simple Interactive Multiple Programming Language Learner (SIMPLL)
============
***

SIMPLL pronounced “simple” is a set of batch files (windows cmd) and
other bundled third party products which let you start learning multiple
programming languages using interactive shells (or as some say
interactive interpreters).

Introduction
============

SIMPLL was created in order for new developers to learn multiple
programming/scripting languages rather easily using interactive shells
(or interpreters). The main approach of this project is to ensure that
the end users don’t need to worry about downloading ton of files and
setting up the system before start learning a programming/scripting
language. SIMPLL enables you to jump start your learning process in not
just one but multiple programming/scripting languages. All you need to
do is download a file and install or extract it and all is complete.
